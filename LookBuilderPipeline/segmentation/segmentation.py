# Import necessary image processing libraries (e.g., Pillow for handling image objects)
from PIL import Image  

# @Daniel: The purpose of this function is to segment the input image into parts,
# where the minimum requirement is to return the outfit, and then optionally add other items
# like shoes, handbags, etc.
#
# The image parameter is an actual image object, not the path, and we need to process it accordingly.
#
# To Do (@Daniel):
# - Implement code that processes the image object using an image processing library (e.g., Pillow, OpenCV).
# - The function should always return the segmented outfit (mandatory).
# - Optionally, depending on the additional option provided (e.g., "shoes", "handbag"), segment those items as well.
# - Return two outputs:
#   1. The segmented outfit (minimum).
#   2. A binary mask of the segmented area (including additional items like shoes if specified).
