# @Daniel: The purpose of this function is to return the pose of the input image.
# This pose data will later be used to ensure that the generated image 
# (created in a future step) accurately matches the pose of the talent in the input image.
# The goal is to make sure that the generated image aligns perfectly with the pose of the 
# original model, ensuring consistency between the input and the generated output.
#
# To Do (@Daniel):
# - Implement code that processes the input image.
# - Extract the pose (key points like limbs, face orientation, etc.).
# - Return the pose data in a format that can be used later in the pipeline.
