# @Daniel: This function will use Stable Diffusion 3 with ControlNet to generate a new image.
# It will take three inputs:
# 1. Pose: The pose detected earlier in the pipeline (ControlNet will be used to copy the pose).
# 2. Clothes: The segmented clothes (outfit) generated earlier.
# 3. Mask: The mask generated earlier to define the segmented area.
#
# Stable Diffusion 3 will be used with ControlNet for fill painting and ensuring the pose is copied correctly.
# 
# To Do (@Daniel):
# - Integrate Stable Diffusion 3 with ControlNet into this function.
# - Use ControlNet to ensure the generated image matches the input pose.
# - Use fill painting to ensure that the clothes fit the pose correctly within the boundaries defined by the mask.
